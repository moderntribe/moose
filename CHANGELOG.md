# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Each changelog entry gets prefixed with the category of the
item (Added, Changed, Depreciated, Removed, Fixed, Security).

## [2025.12]

- Fixed: Image Card & Image Overlay Card blocks now properly pass animation attributes to the animation helper class.
- Added: Inline Notice Block
- Updated: Logo Marquee block now has updated padding between images & contains a range selector to adjust the marquee speed as needed.
- Added: Caption elements in media blocks (Image, Video, Embed) are now contained to the content width.
- Updated: Cleaned up core Details block with comments, consistent underline styling, and reordered `theme.json` styles for clarity.
- Updated: Decorative Heading block now uses `<div>` instead of `<span>` so Headings remain block-level elements without needing extra styling.
- Added: Cover block & Featured Image block now support the border radius setting.
- Added: Paragraph block now properly gets it's `wp-block-paragraph` class name. At some point this was removed from core but we rely on it to target some styling for balanced text.
- Fixed: Masthead Search icon now properly loads across environments.
- Updated: Terms block shouldn't error when used on a CPT that doesn't contain the `category` taxonomy.

## [2025.11]

- Updated: Masthead is now only sticky on tablet/desktop viewports (> 600px).
- Updated: Color themes now include a padding spacer `--group-themed-default-padding` to ensure content has default inner spacing. This can be overwritten with the block gap settings. This is contextualized to the main content area.
- Added: Custom media query `--mq-allow-animations` checks for `no-preference` value for better a11y on animations.
- Removed: The Page post type no longer has default content loaded into it when creating a new page. Pages should start blank.

## [2025.08]

- Updated: pre-commit hooks now no longer run if the commit does not include files related to the hook. Pre-commit hooks now also include FE linting.

- Updated: 404 & Search templates have been updated to Moose 2.0 design standards.
- Fixed: Issue with editor pattern / template previews (still using `iframe` elements) displaying at the wrong width.
