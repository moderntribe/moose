# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Each changelog entry gets prefixed with the category of the
item (Added, Changed, Depreciated, Removed, Fixed, Security).

## [2025.02]
- Chore: WordPress plugin updates.

## [2025.01]
- Chore: WordPress plugin updates, Composer & NPM package updates.
- Updated: Inline link styling should now apply to all links inside the post content block that do not have a 
  class assigned to them. This should exclude things like buttons & navigation.
- Added: `Admin_Menu_Order` class to handle reordering the WP Admin menu items that Moose loads with by default.
  This also includes Yoast SEO & RankMath, just in case either are used by default. 
- Added: Node service to Lando so FE assets can be built automatically on start up.
- Updated: project start up scripts to automatically generate the correct contents of the lcoal config files.
- Updated: script to install WordPress so we can use a version constant and not install WP every time composer is
  installed or updated.
- Updated: ESLint config now supports browser environment variables such as `IntersectionObserver`
- Added: ability for table blocks to utilize the `overflow-x` set on them by setting a `min-width` property for the
  `table` element within the table block.
- Updated: Enabled background images on the Group block; We should try to use this instead of the Cover block where
  possible.
- Added: 1Password CLI integration for automating the creation of auth.json files.
- Added: A composite GitHub action for composer installs. This composite action can be used in any workflow files that
  need to composer install.
- Updated: `lando start` now automatically creates local config files and composer installs on first run. This
  eliminates those as manual steps when starting a project for the first time.
- Updated: Misc small tweaks to composer & package files & scripts for consistency and ease of use.
- Updated: GitHub action workflows to use new composite action for composer installs as well other small improvements
  and updates to workflows
